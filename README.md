# Programming Assignment 2

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Raymundo_Pandas-P1.ipynb` & `Raymundo_Pandas-P2.ipynb`) that demonstrates two programming exercises using the **PANDAS** library.

# Cars Dataset Analysis with Pandas

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **pandas** in Python to explore and analyze a dataset of cars.  
It is divided into two Jupyter Notebooks:

## Exercise 1:

  Introduces pandas basics:
  - Reading CSV files into DataFrames
  - Displaying datasets
  - Previewing data with `.head()` and `.tail()`

## Exercise 2:

 Focuses on data selection and filtering:
  - Selecting specific rows and columns using `iloc` and `loc`
  - Filtering rows by conditions
  - Extracting subsets of data (odd columns, specific indices, models)

## Together, these notebooks provide a foundation for working with real-world datasets using pandas.

## How to Run

To run the notebook, you need to have **Anaconda Navigator** installed and open **Jupyter Notebook**.

1.  Download the `Raymundo_Pandas-P1.ipynb` & `Raymundo_Pandas-P2.ipynb` files.
2.  Start the Jupyter Notebook server:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  Your web browser will open, upload `Raymundo_Pandas-P1.ipynb` & `Raymundo_Pandas-P2.ipynb`, and then click on them both to open and run the notebooks.
